After an almost six hour journey you finally arrive at the home where you will
stay and work as a live in maid. It doesn't pay much but at least room and board
are free and who knows you could always find another job.

You ring the doorbell and a middle aged woman opens the door.

"Laura!", she smiles, "You've arrived. Good, good, come on in."

After a short introduction to her husband, you are shown your bedroom. "This where
you can sleep," she said, "The bathroom is just across the hallway and I can show
you the kitchen later. You must be tired after that long trip."

You were and you really had been looking forward to a good shower and some rest,
sitting for that long had been tiring. As she left the room you looked around and
it wasn't much, but it was home for now.
