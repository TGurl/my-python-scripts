It's a beautiful day in Greenvale and you are standing on a rather desolate
trainstation if it weren't for your family and boyfriend of six years.

"Why do you have to go?" your little sister asked.

"I have a new job," you replied, "and I have to go. You can come visit me
if you want to."

"Can I?"

"Sure, you're always welcome."

Your sisters eyes lit up and you turned towards your boyfriend Mike. He
was the one that had pointed her to the add, but now it was reality he wasn't
so sure he had done the right thing.

"I don't like it," he whispered, "Can't you reconsider?"

"Mike!," you whispered, "This was YOUR idea. And no I can't go back now."

You wanted to say more but the noice of the arriving train made speacj all
but impossible. Your father helped you carry your luggage on the train and
as he embraced you he whispered "You're always welcome home kid, you know
that right?" You nodded, kissed him on the cheek and whispered "Yes dad, I
know."

It was time to go, the whistle indicated the train was about to leave and
your father hurried off. As the train set in motion you waved to your loved
ones and realilty sank in. You felt excited and scared at the same time, but
it would not be for a few hours before you would arrive.

'Time to get some rest,' you think and stare out the window
